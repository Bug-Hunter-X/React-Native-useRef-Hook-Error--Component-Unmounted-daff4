This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the ref's callback is executed. This typically happens when a component is quickly unmounted, such as during navigation or when the parent component re-renders rapidly.  The callback attempts to access or modify a DOM element that no longer exists, leading to a runtime error.  Example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
    return () => {
      // cleanup
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput ref={inputRef} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
